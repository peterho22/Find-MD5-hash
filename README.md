# Find-MD5-hash
Python script that identifies which plaintext file matches a given MD5 hash using hashlib and pathlib.

## Dataset Setup

This project requires a dataset.

Expected directory structure:

.
├── findingMD5hash.py
├── message_hash.md5 #target hash
└── plain_files/ #files to scan
    ├── file1.txt
    ├── file2.txt
    └── ...

Note: The dataset files are not included in this repository due to size constraints.
Users should place the dataset in the same directory as the script.
